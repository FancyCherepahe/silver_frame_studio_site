                Out of Ink Machine: Left in the Dust
                "God made us in His image… but who made Him?"

                Decades have passed since the machines stopped and the ink dried. Now, you're drawn back to where it all began — a place abandoned by time, buried under dust and silence. But something still lingers here. Something that speaks in whispers and watches through walls of ink.

                Left in the Dust is a psychological horror experience that delves deep into themes of death, faith, and the madness of creation. What was once a studio is now a shrine. The lines between worship and fear have blurred, and a new god demands devotion.

                You're not a hero — you're what's left behind. And the truth waiting in the dark may be worse than death.</p>
        <h2 class="main_title">Main Game Feature</h2>
            <p class="main_text">A haunting descent into religious obsession and artistic insanity.</p>

            <p class="main_text">Narrative themes exploring mortality, godhood, and the dangers of belief.</p>

            <p class="main_text">Ink-stained halls echoing with chants, rituals, and broken prayers.</p>

            <p class="main_text">Horror not through jumpscares, but through the dread of what’s unseen — and what’s believed.</p>
